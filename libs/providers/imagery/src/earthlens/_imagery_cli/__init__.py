"""CLI-tooling table for the `earthlens-imagery` provider distribution.

Published to core's catalog-tooling commands through the `earthlens.cli`
entry-point group and merged by `earthlens._cli_tooling.discover_cli_tooling`.

Import-light by contract (the sibling of `earthlens._imagery`): this module names
each provider's handlers as `"module:attr"` targets, never importing the handler
modules or their SDKs.
